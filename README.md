# Chocolate Python library

Creating plugin-like backends using [Python `entry_point`](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/).

This is the main library and [parallel-coco](https://github.com/Schefflera-Arboricola/parallel-coco) is the backend library having an alternative implementation. It only supports type-based dispatching.
